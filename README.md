# Healthcare-Institutions-SQL-Analysis-ODHF-Project-
This project explores the Open Database of Healthcare Facilities (ODHF) to understand how healthcare institutions are distributed across Canada. It includes database design, data cleaning, SQL queries, subqueries, CTEs, and reusable views. The work demonstrates how SQL can transform raw public data into meaningful insights.

🔍 Key SQL Techniques Used

This project demonstrates practical SQL skills, including:

1. Aliases
   
Used to simplify query readability and shorten table references.

3. Subqueries
   
For nested filtering, aggregations, and comparing regional data.

4. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
   
Used to break complex queries into clear, reusable steps.

5. JOINS
   
Inner, left, and conditional joins for combining related tables.

6. Aggregations & Grouping
   
Counting facilities by city, province, provider, and type.

7. Views
   
Reusable views created for user-level reporting and quick summaries.

💡 Insights

Facility distribution varies widely between provinces.

Some regions have significantly fewer healthcare institutions, showing potential gaps.

Providers are unevenly represented, with some dominating certain regions.

Address and coordinate data can be combined to map facilities geographically.

Building CTE-based queries makes the workflow cleaner and easier to maintain.
